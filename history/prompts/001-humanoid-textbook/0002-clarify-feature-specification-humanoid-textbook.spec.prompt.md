## Prompt

```text
/sp.clarify
```

## Response snapshot

```text
No critical ambiguities were detected in the feature specification that require formal clarification at this stage.

**Spec File Path**: `/mnt/c/Study/claude-code/Book-hackathon/the-humanoid-blueprint/specs/001-humanoid-textbook/spec.md`

You can now proceed to plan the implementation using `/sp.plan`.
```

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Spec was reviewed and found to have no critical ambiguities requiring user input.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: No files were modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: User can now run `/sp.plan` to create the implementation plan.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully reviewed the spec for ambiguities and determined no further clarification was needed at this stage, adhering to the principle of not asking unnecessary questions.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
