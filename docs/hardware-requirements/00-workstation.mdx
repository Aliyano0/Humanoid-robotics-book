# Workstation Requirements

This section outlines the hardware requirements for developing humanoid robots, including recommended specifications for workstations, GPU requirements, and considerations for the "Latency Trap" that can impact real-time robotics applications.

## Workstation Specifications

### Minimum Requirements

|-----------|---------------|-------|
| CPU | Intel i7-10700K or AMD Ryzen 7 3700X | 8+ cores, 3.0+ GHz |
| RAM | 32 GB DDR4 | 2933 MHz or faster |
| GPU | NVIDIA RTX 3070 | 8 GB VRAM minimum |
| Storage | 1 TB SSD | NVMe preferred |
| OS | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS | Primary development environment |

### Recommended Requirements
| Component | Specification | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| CPU | Intel i9-12900K or AMD Ryzen 9 5900X | 16+ cores for simulation |
| RAM | 64 GB DDR4/DDR5 | 3200 MHz or faster |

| Storage | 1 TB NVMe SSD | ~$50 | Adequate for development |
| Total | - | ~$850 | Great starting point |

## GPU Requirements for AI/Robotics

### Simulation and Training
- **Minimum**: RTX 3070 (8GB) - Basic simulation and small model training
- **Recommended**: RTX 4080/4090 (16-24GB) - Complex simulation and model training
- **Professional**: RTX A5000/A6000 (24GB+) - Production-level work

### Deep Learning Considerations
- VRAM is critical for batch sizes and model complexity
- CUDA cores affect training and inference speed
- Tensor cores accelerate mixed-precision operations
- Consider power consumption (200-450W) and cooling

## The Latency Trap

### What is the Latency Trap?
The "Latency Trap" is a common pitfall in humanoid robotics development where excessive processing delays cause systems to become non-responsive or unstable. In real-time robotics applications, especially those involving dynamic balance or interaction, delays above certain thresholds can make the system unusable or even dangerous.

### Critical Latency Thresholds
| Operation | Safe Latency | Performance Impact | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| Balance Control | < 10ms | Stability degradation | Critical for walking robots |
| Visual Servoing | < 30ms | Tracking accuracy | Important for manipulation |
| Collision Avoidance | < 50ms | Safety risk | Essential for safe operation |
| Human Interaction | < 100ms | Naturalness | User experience factor |

### Latency Sources and Solutions
| Source | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| CPU Processing | 5-50ms | Multi-threading, optimized algorithms |
| GPU Processing | 10-100ms | GPU acceleration, batch processing |
| Network Communication | 1-100ms | Local processing, 5G/edge computing |
| Sensor Readout | 1-20ms | Fast sensors, direct connections |
| Motor Control | 1-10ms | Real-time OS, dedicated controllers |

### Avoiding the Latency Trap
1. **Profile Everything**: Measure actual latencies in your system
2. **Prioritize Critical Paths**: Ensure safety-critical systems have the lowest latency
3. **Use Real-Time OS**: Consider RT kernel or dedicated real-time systems
4. **Edge Processing**: Minimize network dependencies for critical functions
5. **Hierarchical Architecture**: Separate fast control loops from slow planning

## Additional Hardware Considerations

### Network Infrastructure
- Gigabit Ethernet (1 Gbps) minimum for robot communication
- 10 Gbps recommended for multi-robot systems
- 5G/6G for wireless applications (where permitted)

### Peripherals
- High-resolution cameras (4K, >60fps)
- LiDAR sensors for navigation
- Inertial Measurement Units (IMU)
- Microphone arrays for audio processing

### Cooling and Power
- Adequate cooling for sustained high-performance operation
- Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) for critical development work
- Power consumption: 800W-1500W for high-end configurations

## Cost Considerations

### Initial Investment vs. Long-term Value
| Approach | Upfront Cost | Long-term Benefits | Use Case |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| High-end Workstation | $4,000-8,000 | Fast development, future-proof | Professional/R&D |
| Mid-range Setup | $1,500-3,000 | Good balance | Serious hobbyist/Student |
| Budget Build | $800-1,500 | Accessible entry point | Learning/Curious beginner |
