# ROS 2 Key Concepts

This section delves into the fundamental concepts of ROS 2, including nodes, topics, services, actions, and parameters, explaining how they form the backbone of robotic applications.

## Nodes

Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of a ROS 2 system. Each node is a process that performs computation. Multiple nodes work together to form a complete robotic application. Nodes are designed to be modular and focused on a single task.

## Topics and Message Passing

Topics enable asynchronous communication between nodes using a publish-subscribe pattern. Publishers send messages to topics, and subscribers receive messages from topics. This decouples the sender and receiver, allowing for flexible system design.

## Services

Services provide synchronous request-response communication between nodes. A client sends a request to a service, and the service processes the request and sends back a response. This is useful for operations that require a definite outcome.

## Actions

Actions are used for long-running tasks that have goals, feedback, and results. Unlike services, actions are asynchronous and provide ongoing feedback during execution. They're ideal for tasks like navigation or manipulation.

## Parameters

Parameters are configuration values that can be changed at runtime. They allow nodes to be configured without recompilation and can be set at launch time or changed dynamically during execution.

## Packages and Workspaces

ROS 2 organizes code into packages, which contain nodes, libraries, and other resources. Multiple packages are organized into workspaces for building and managing related functionality.

:::tip
Think of nodes as individual workers in a factory, each responsible for a specific task. Topics are like conveyor belts moving information between workers, services are like direct requests between workers, and actions are like complex projects that require ongoing communication and feedback.

ROS 2 uses DDS (Data Distribution Service) as its underlying communication middleware, providing reliable, real-time data exchange between nodes.
