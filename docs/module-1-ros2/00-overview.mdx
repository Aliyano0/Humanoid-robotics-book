# Overview of ROS 2: The Robotic Nervous System

This module introduces the Robot Operating System (ROS 2) as the foundational "nervous system" for physical AI, enabling various components of a robot to communicate and work together seamlessly.

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is not an operating system but rather a flexible framework for writing robot software. It provides libraries, tools, and conventions that simplify the development of complex, robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms and configurations.

## Key Components of ROS 2

- **Nodes**: Processes that perform computation
- **Topics**: Named buses over which nodes exchange messages
- **Services**: Synchronous request/response communication
- **Actions**: Asynchronous goal-oriented communication
- **Parameters**: Configuration values that can be changed at runtime
- **Launch files**: XML/YAML files that start multiple nodes at once

:::tip
Think of ROS 2 as the communication backbone that allows different parts of your robot (sensors, actuators, controllers) to talk to each other in a standardized way.
:::

:::info
ROS 2 is the evolution of the original ROS, designed to address the needs of production systems with improved security, real-time capabilities, and multi-robot systems.

In this module, you'll learn how to create your first ROS 2 nodes, understand the publish-subscribe pattern, and build a simple communication system that forms the basis for all robot functionality.
