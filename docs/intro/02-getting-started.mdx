# Getting Started

This section provides a gentle introduction to setting up the environment and understanding the core concepts before diving into the modules.

:::tip
Don't worry if you don't meet all prerequisites immediately. You can learn as you go, and the modular structure allows you to jump to specific sections that interest you most.

## Prerequisites

Before starting with this textbook, you should have:
- Basic programming knowledge in Python or C++
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of fundamental mathematics (linear algebra, calculus)
- Access to a computer with at least 16GB RAM and a modern GPU (NVIDIA preferred)

## Required Software

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or later (or WSL2 on Windows)
- ROS 2 Kilted Kaiju
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim 5.1+ (with compatible GPU)
- Git version control
- Node.js 18+ and npm

## Getting the Most from This Book

This textbook is designed to be hands-on and practical. Each module builds on the previous one, leading to a complete autonomous humanoid robot by the end. We recommend:
- Following along with all examples
- Experimenting with modifications to deepen understanding
- Referring to the appendices for additional resources
- Participating in the community discussions for support

:::tip
Don't worry if you're new to robotics! We'll start with the fundamentals and gradually build up to more complex concepts.
