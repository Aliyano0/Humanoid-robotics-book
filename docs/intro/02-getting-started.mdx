## Prerequisites

Before starting with this textbook, you should have:
- Basic programming knowledge in Python or C++
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of fundamental mathematics (linear algebra, calculus)
- Access to a computer with at least 16GB RAM and a modern GPU (NVIDIA preferred)

## Required Software

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or later (or WSL2 on Windows)
- ROS 2 Kilted Kaiju
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim 5.1+ (with compatible GPU)
- Git version control

## Getting the Most from This Book

This textbook is designed to be hands-on and practical. Each module builds on the previous one, leading to a complete autonomous humanoid robot by the end. We recommend:
- Following along with all examples
- Experimenting with modifications to deepen understanding
- Referring to the appendices for additional resources
- Participating in the community discussions for support
