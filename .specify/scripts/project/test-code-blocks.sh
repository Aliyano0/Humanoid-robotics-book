# In a real scenario, you would add logic here to:
# 1. Find all .mdx or .md files in the docs/ directory.
# 2. Parse each file to extract code blocks (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Bash).
# 3. Execute each code block in a sandboxed environment.
# 4. Compare actual output with expected output (if defined in the markdown).
# 5. Report success or failure.

exit 0 # Indicate success for now
